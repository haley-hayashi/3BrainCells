// pseudocode for the crafting mechanics


VARIABLES NEEDED
1) bool for each ingredient
2) var (int) for counting how many ingredients have been used
3) var (int) for counting how many drinks have been served

maybe a var (int) for how many ingredients are on the screen, preventing too many from being spawned at once?
	- needs implementation of a trash mechanic

//-------ingredient management (spawning, tracking, despawning)


//implement click/drag functionality for ingredients
	
//if an ingredient collides with the mug
	//have some sort of interface to show that it's inside (bottom a + b = c, or have it appear as an icon that moves with the mug)
	//move ingredient asset to start
	//ingredient counter up so that number of ingredients used in drink cannnot exceed 2
		//if ingredient counter is 2 or more, ingredients cannot be killed by the mug anymore
	//boolean to tell us which ingredients were used 

		
//------------coffee machine interaction

//if the go button is pressed, change the appearance of the mug to "filled", but only if it was "empty" before
	//if it wasn't in the empty state, then break

//---------serving

//if the total drink counter for the day exceeds the number of customers for the day (2 on first day, 4 for other days), 

//if total = 1 && drink is finished, pressing the serve button will serve the drink & reset ingredient counter + booleans; add to a total drink counter
	//if the correct 2 ingredients are marked as "true", payment will be x
	//else, payment will be x - y
//else, pressing serve will do nothing
