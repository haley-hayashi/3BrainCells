// pseudocode for the crafting mechanics


VARIABLES NEEDED
1) bool for each ingredient
2) var (int) for counting how many ingredients have been used
3) var (int) for counting how many drinks have been served

maybe a var (int) for how many ingredients are on the screen, preventing too many from being spawned at once?
	- needs implementation of a trash mechanic

//-------ingredient management (spawning, tracking, despawning)

//make and place buttons for ingredients on the table (resized, non-moveable versions of the ingredients, maybe with some sort of border to show that it's a button rather than an interactable)

//if a button is pressed, spawn in 1 matching ingredient asset
	//implement click/drag functionality for ingredients
	
//if an ingredient collides with the mug
	//have some sort of interface to show that it's inside (bottom a + b = c, or have it appear as an icon that moves with the mug)
	//kill ingredient asset
	//ingredient counter up so that number of ingredients used in drink cannnot exceed 2
		//if ingredient counter is 2 or more, ingredients cannot be killed by the mug anymore
	//boolean to tell us which ingredients were used 


//implement trash button that clears the mug?
	//if the trash button is interacted with (mug to trash)
		//counter drops to 0 and crafting interface is reset
	//if the trash button is interacted with (loose ingredient to trash)
		//kill ingredient asset
		
//------------coffee machine interaction

//if the go button is pressed, change the appearance of the mug to "filled", but only if it was "empty" before
	//if it wasn't in the empty state, then break
	
//maybe try to see if the go button can work only for when the cup is "within range'?

//---------serving

//if the total drink counter for the day exceeds the number of customers for the day (2 on first day, 4 for other days), 

//if total = 1 && drink is finished, pressing the serve button will serve the drink & reset ingredient counter + booleans; add to a total drink counter
	//if the correct 2 ingredients are marked as "true", payment will be x
	//else, payment will be x - y
//else, pressing serve will do nothing
